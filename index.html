   <h2>Overview</h2>
  <div class="over">
  For more than 5 years was working as a professional-client relationship and purchasing manager with deep knowledge and wide experience in working with Chinese clients. The responsibilities always required attention to details, quality control of the products and high level of the communication with the clients and our team. 
    During software testing, I analyze products from different perspectives and look for issues and bugs. This helps to make the products better and thereby helps in growing confidence regarding it. I have three months of testing experience and my work inspires me. I am looking for a competitive and promising company where I can use my ability to communicate with people, take advantage of my knowledge of testing and grow as a professional in QA.
